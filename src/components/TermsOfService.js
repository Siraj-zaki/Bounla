He is then redirected to a page describing the subscription fees to this Creator.<br />
                                        <br />
Through the subscription, the Creators and Users obtains access to exclusive Content, access to uncensored media (removal of &quot;blurring&quot; on the Content of The Creator), as well as the possibility of getting closer to The Creator to formulate requests for private media.<br />
                                        <br />
